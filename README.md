# Xcode Build for testing for iOS

[![Step changelog](https://shields.io/github/v/release/bitrise-steplib/steps-xcode-build-for-test?include_prereleases&label=changelog&color=blueviolet)](https://github.com/bitrise-steplib/steps-xcode-build-for-test/releases)

Performs xcodebuild's build-for-testing action

<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

The Step runs Xcode's `xcodebuild` command with the `build-for-testing` option. This builds your app for testing and also creates an `.xctestrun` file. 

### Configuring the Step 

At a minimum, the Step needs valid values for three inputs:

- **Project (or Workspace) path**: This is the path to the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file. In most cases, leave it on the default value.
- **Scheme name**: The name of your Xcode scheme. By default, the Step will use the scheme that was set when you added the app on Bitrise.
- **Device destination**: The device and platform type to build the tests for. For available values call, `man xcodebuild` and check the Destinations section. 
We also recommend checking out our [System reports page](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/tree/master/system_reports) on GitHub: you can check out the available, pre-installed simulators and other tools. 

Optionally, you can define the configuration to use in the **Configuration name** input. Normally, the scheme defines the configuration type, such as **debug** or **release**.

The Step can also cache your Swift PM dependencies. To enable caching, make sure the **Enable caching of Swift Package Manager packages** input is set to `swift_packages`.

### Troubleshooting

In the **Debug** option group, you can:

- Add additional flags to the xcodebuild command.
- Enable verbose logging.
- Change the output directory path and the output tool.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

<details>
<summary>Inputs</summary>

| Key | Description | Flags | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `project_path` | Xcode Project (`.xcodeproj`) or Workspace (`.xcworkspace`) path.  The input value sets xcodebuild's `-project` or `-workspace` option. | required | `$BITRISE_PROJECT_PATH` |
| `scheme` | Xcode Scheme name.  The input value sets xcodebuild's `-scheme` option. | required | `$BITRISE_SCHEME` |
| `configuration` | Xcode Build Configuration.  If not specified, the default Build Configuration will be used.  The input value sets xcodebuild's `-configuration` option. | required | `Debug` |
| `destination` | Destination specifier describes the device to use as a destination.  The input value sets xcodebuild's `-destination` option. | required | `generic/platform=iOS` |
| `xcconfig_content` | Build settings to override the project's build settings.  Build settings must be separated by newline character (`\n`).  Example:  ``` COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE = NO ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH[config=Debug][sdk=*][arch=*] = YES ```  The input value sets xcodebuild's `-xcconfig` option. |  | `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE = NO` |
| `xcodebuild_options` | Additional options to be added to the executed xcodebuild command. |  |  |
| `log_formatter` | Defines how xcodebuild command's log is formatted.  Available options: - `xcpretty`: The xcodebuild command‚Äôs output will be prettified by xcpretty. - `xcodebuild`: Only the last 20 lines of raw xcodebuild output will be visible in the build log.  The raw xcodebuild log will be exported in both cases. | required | `xcpretty` |
| `output_dir` | This directory will contain the generated artifacts. | required | `$BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR` |
| `cache_level` | Defines what cache content should be automatically collected.  Available options: - `none`: Disable collecting cache content. - `swift_packages`: Collect Swift PM packages added to the Xcode project. | required | `swift_packages` |
| `verbose_log` | If this input is set, the Step will print additional logs for debugging. | required | `no` |
