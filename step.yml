title: "Xcode Build for testing for iOS"
summary: Performs xcodebuild's build-for-testing action
description: |- 
  The Step runs Xcode's `xcodebuild` command with the `build-for-testing` option. This builds your app for testing and also creates an `.xctestrun` file. 
  
  ### Configuring the Step 
  
  At a minimum, the Step needs valid values for three inputs:
  
  - **Project (or Workspace) path**: This is the path to the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file. In most cases, leave it on the default value.
  - **Scheme name**: The name of your Xcode scheme. By default, the Step will use the scheme that was set when you added the app on Bitrise.
  - **Device destination**: The device and platform type to build the tests for. For available values call, `man xcodebuild` and check the Destinations section. 
  We also recommend checking out our [System reports page](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/tree/master/system_reports) on GitHub: you can check out the available, pre-installed simulators and other tools. 
  
  Optionally, you can define the configuration to use in the **Configuration name** input. Normally, the scheme defines the configuration type, such as **debug** or **release**.
  
  The Step can also cache your Swift PM dependencies. To enable caching, make sure the **Enable caching of Swift Package Manager packages** input is set to `swift_packages`.
  
  ### Troubleshooting
  
  In the **Debug** option group, you can:
  
  - Add additional flags to the `xcodebuild` command. 
  - Enable verbose logging.
  - Change the output directory path and the output tool.
