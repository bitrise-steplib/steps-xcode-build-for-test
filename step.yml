title: "[BETA] Xcode Build for testing for iOS"
summary: Performs xcodebuild's build-for-testing action
description: |- 
  The Step runs Xcode's `xcodebuild` command with the `build-for-testing` flag. This builds your app for testing and also creates an `.xctestrun` file. 
  
  ### Configuring the Step 
  
  At a minimum, the Step needs valid values for three inputs:
  
  - **Project (or Workspace) path**: This is the path to the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` file. In most cases, leave it on the default value.
  - **Scheme name**: The name of your Xcode scheme. By default, the Step will use the scheme that was set when you added the app on Bitrise.
  - **Device destination**: The device and platform type to build the tests for. For available values call, `man xcodebuild` and check the Destinations section. 
  
  Optionally, you can define the configuration to use in the **Configuration name** input. Normally, the scheme defines the configuration type, such as **debug** or **release**.
  
  The Step can also cache your Swift PM dependencies. To enable caching, make sure the **Enable caching of Swift Package Manager packages** input is set to `swift_packages`.
  
  ### Troubleshooting
  
  In the **Debug** option group, you can:
  
  - Add additional flags to the `xcodebuild` command. 
  - Enable verbose logging.
  - Change the output directory path and the output tool.

        (optional) The configuration to use. By default your Scheme
        defines which configuration (Debug, Release, ...) should be used,
        but you can overwrite it with this option.
        **Make sure that the Configuration you specify actually exists
        in your Xcode Project**. If it does not, if you have a typo
        in the value of this input Xcode will simply use the Configuration
        specified by the Scheme and will silently ignore this parameter!

      description: |-
        Could make the build faster by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command which will disable the indexing during the build.

        Indexing is needed for
        
        * Autocomplete
        * Ability to quickly jump to definition
        * Get class and method help by alt clicking.

        Which are not needed in CI environment.

        **Note:** In Xcode you can turn off the `Index-WhileBuilding` feature  by disabling the `Enable Index-WhileBuilding Functionality` in the `Build Settings`.<br/>
        In CI environment you can disable it by adding `COMPILER_INDEX_STORE_ENABLE=NO` flag to the `xcodebuild` command.
