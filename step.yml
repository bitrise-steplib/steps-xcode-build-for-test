title: Xcode Build for testing for iOS
summary: Performs xcodebuild's build-for-testing action
description: |-
  The Step runs Xcode's `xcodebuild` command with the `build-for-testing` option. This builds your app and associated tests so that you can, for example, upload it to a third-party testing service to run your tests on a real device.
  The Step also creates an `.xctestrun` file.
  To be able to run your tests on a real device it needs code signing. The **Automatic code signing method** Step input allows you to log you into your Apple Developer account based on the [Apple service connection you provide on Bitrise](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/accounts/connecting-to-services/apple-services-connection.html) and download any provisioning profiles needed for your project based on the **Distribution method**.
  Please note that the **Automatic code signing method** input is by default set to `off`, so if you need code signing, select either the `api-key` or the `apple-id`option of the input.

  ### Configuring the Step
  Before you start:
  - Make sure you have connected your [Apple Service account to Bitrise](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/accounts/connecting-to-services/apple-services-connection.html).
  Alternatively, you can upload certificates and profiles to Bitrise manually, then use the **Certificate and Profile Installer** Step before this Step.
  - Make sure certificates are uploaded to Bitrise's **Code Signing** tab. The right provisioning profiles are automatically downloaded from Apple as part of the automatic code signing process.

  To configure the Step:
  1. **Project (or Workspace) path**: This is the path where the `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` files are localed.
  2. **Scheme**: Add the scheme name you wish to build for testing.
  3. **Build Configuration**: If not specified, the default Build Configuration will be used. The input value sets xcodebuild's `-configuration` option.
  4. **Device destination specifier**: Destination specifier describes the device to use as a destination. The input value sets xcodebuild's `-destination` option.

  Under **xcodebuild configuration**
  5. **Build settings (xcconfig)**:  Build settings to override the project's build settings. Can be the contents, file path or empty.
  6. **Additional options for the xcodebuild command**:  Additional options to be added to the executed xcodebuild command.

  Under **Xcode build log formatting**:
  1. **Log formatter**: Defines how `xcodebuild` command's log is formatted. Available options: `xcpretty`: The xcodebuild command's output will be prettified by xcpretty. `xcodebuild`: Only the last 20 lines of raw xcodebuild output will be visible in the build log. The raw xcodebuild log is exported in both cases.

  Under **Automatic code signing**:
  1. **Automatic code signing method**: Select the Apple service connection you want to use for code signing. Available options: `off` if you don't do automatic code signing, `api-key` [if you use API key authorization](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/accounts/connecting-to-services/connecting-to-an-apple-service-with-api-key.html), and `apple-id` [if you use Apple ID authorization](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/en/accounts/connecting-to-services/connecting-to-an-apple-service-with-apple-id.html).
  2. **Register test devices on the Apple Developer Portal**: If this input is set, the Step will register the known test devices on Bitrise from team members with the Apple Developer Portal. Note that setting this to `yes` may cause devices to be registered against your limited quantity of test devices in the Apple Developer Portal, which can only be removed once annually during your renewal window.
  3. **The minimum days the Provisioning Profile should be valid**: If this input is set to >0, the managed Provisioning Profile will be renewed if it expires within the configured number of days. Otherwise the Step renews the managed Provisioning Profile if it is expired.
  4. The **Code signing certificate URL**, the **Code signing certificate passphrase**, the **Keychain path**, and the **Keychain password** inputs are automatically populated if certificates are uploaded to Bitrise's **Code Signing** tab. If you store your files in a private repo, you can manually edit these fields.

  Under **Step Output configuration**:
  1. **Output directory path**: This directory contains the generated artifacts.

  Under **Caching**:
  1. **Enable collecting cache content**: Defines what cache content should be automatically collected. Available options are:
    - `none`: Disable collecting cache content
    - `swift_packages`: Collect Swift PM packages added to the Xcode project

  Under Debugging:
  1. **Verbose logging***: You can set this input to `yes` to produce more informative logs.
